<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>My potato pet</strong> mobile application (the “App”), developed by
<strong>Juan Alejandro Acosta Barron</strong> (the “Developer”). The App is provided as an ad-supported game and is
offered as is.
</p>

<p>
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>
The App does not require registration and does not ask users to provide personal information such as name,
email address, or phone number.
</p>

<p>
However, the App uses third-party services that may automatically collect certain information in order to
provide ads, process purchases, and improve the service.
</p>

<p>This information may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device information (such as device model and operating system)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>App usage data</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA)</li>
    <li>Crash and performance data</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Developer does not directly collect or store personal data.
</p>

<h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>

<p>
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
</p>

<p>
AdMob may collect and use information such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Device information</li>
    <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is used to show ads and measure their performance. Ads may be personalized or non-personalized
depending on your settings and permissions.
</p>

<h2>App Tracking Transparency (iOS)</h2>

<p>
On iOS devices, the App may request permission through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you allow tracking, AdMob may use the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) to provide personalized ads.</li>
    <li>If you deny tracking, ads may still be shown but will be less relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can change your tracking preference at any time in your device’s system settings.
</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>
The App offers optional in-app purchases.
</p>

<p>
All payments are processed securely by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apple App Store (on iOS)</li>
    <li>Google Play Store (on Android)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Developer does not collect or store payment information. Transaction data is handled entirely by Apple or
Google in accordance with their privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>
The Developer does not store personal data directly. Any data processed by third-party services is protected
according to their respective security practices.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use
of the App after changes means acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-01
</p>

<p>
Third-party services used by the App are governed by their own privacy policies, including Google AdMob,
Apple App Store, and Google Play Store.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the Developer at:
