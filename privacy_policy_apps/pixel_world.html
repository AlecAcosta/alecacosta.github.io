    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Pixel World</strong> mobile application (the “App”), developed by
        <strong>Juan Alejandro Acosta Barron</strong> (the “Developer”). The App is provided as an ad-supported game and is
        offered as is.
    </p>

    <p>
        The App is not directed to children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>
        The App does not require registration and does not ask users to provide personal information such as name,
        email address, or phone number.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the App uses third-party services that may automatically collect certain information in order to
        provide ads, process purchases, and improve the service.
    </p>

    <p>This information may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (such as device model and operating system)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App usage data</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>Crash and performance data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Developer does not directly collect or store personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>

    <p>
        The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
    </p>

    <p>
        AdMob may collect and use information such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information is used to show ads and measure their performance. Ads may be personalized or
        non-personalized depending on your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

    <p>
        The App offers optional in-app purchases.
    </p>

    <p>
        All payments are processed securely by the Google Play Store.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Developer does not collect or store payment information. Transaction data is handled entirely by
        Google in accordance with its privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>
        The Developer does not store personal data directly. Any data processed by third-party services is protected
        according to their respective security practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use
        of the App after changes means acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-01
    </p>

    <p>
        Third-party services used by the App are governed by their own privacy policies, including Google AdMob
        and Google Play Store.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the Developer at:
